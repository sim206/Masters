<h1>Evaluating the efficacy of satellite imagery on the surveying of marine plastic litter and gas emissions for use on Gili Islands, Indonesia </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

The aim of this report was to analyse the efficiency of utilising satellite imagery and remote sensing to monitor gas emissions and plastic offshore and is in collaboration with Trignomix and an NGO (Gili Eco Trust). The NGO, a client of Trignomix, experience a substantial amount of waste (mainly plastic) wash up on the shores of the island and wish to monitor it through satellite images. The report was split into two sections: Onshore and Offshore. The region of interest being the Gili Islands, where the NGO are based, and Lombok, located in Indonesia. Resources that were used were the specific satellite datasets available on Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Google Collab using a Python Interface.

<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

The project initially aimed to monitor illegal waste on the Gili Islands using satellite data, but due to the islands' size, this was not feasible. Instead, the focus shifted to monitoring gases such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Methane (CH4) using data from the TROPOMI sensor of Sentinel-5P. The Onshore component was validated through OpenAQ, comparing air quality measurements from ground monitors. Despite limitations, the method showed trends and similarities. The analysis of NO2 and CO during the Gili Fire in 2019 revealed an increase around the fire date. Gas levels during wet and dry seasons were examined, with a slight increase in NO2 during dry seasons. The Onshore component also analyzed the effect of waste sites on gas levels, finding higher levels in specific regions. However, due to the islands' size, the project concluded that monitoring gas emissions might not fully benefit the NGO. 

In terms of fire detection, fire products and satellite datasets were used to track illegal fires on the Gili Trawangan waste site. However, limitations included the islands' size and data loss on the MODIS sensor. The Offshore analysis utilized Sentinel-2 MSI and the Plastic Index to detect plastic litter in the water. The method was validated and applied to monthly images, identifying key areas of plastic pollution north of the Gili Islands. The offshore monitoring method showed promise for both the NGO and Trignomix, despite weaknesses related to cloud cover.

In summary, the project demonstrated the usefulness of free satellite data for waste monitoring, gas detection, and plastic pollution identification. Suggestions for future work include employing machine learning and indexes to detect illegal waste sites, utilizing low spatial resolution data with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for fire mapping, and refining the Plastic Index using machine learning techniques.
